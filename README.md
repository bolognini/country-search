<p align="center">&laquo;<b>A Country Search Selector</b>&raquo;</p>

This project was part of a Frontend test. The challenge consists in creating a an easy and intuitive component to select any country in the world inside a form. The component should be able to achieve a few requirements, such as: typing within the input should call a fuzzy-search in which highlight the matched terms; it should be scrollable and navigable; the result should be a floating component with the found list; etc.

There wasn't tooling limitations. Instead, it was encouraged to choose any libraries that could assist on this deliverable. Therefore, it was built mainly with React, Typescript and Emotion, and some auxiliary libraries. All of them are listed in the end of this document.
