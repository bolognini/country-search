## Description

This project is to only serve as a generic boilerplate for playing around with personal projects. It uses NextJS as the React framework.

### Installing

To run the project on development mode, you just need an LTS Node version installed (v16 or higher recommended), and Yarn for managing the packages. If you haven't it yet, you can follow the [Yarn installation guide](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/docs/install/), on their official page.

With Node and Yarn installed, run the commands below. They will clone the project on the current folder, download all the project dependencies and, in a few minutes, the project will open on your default browser, on the port `:3000`.
